          Department of Human Services Ohana Nui. Ohana Nui is a proven approach
          that capitalizes on Hawaiiâ€™sunique multigenerational family structure
          and provides a framework for human service delivery that positions
          whole families for a chance at greater well-being. Translated as
          extended or large family, Ohana Nui is an adaptation of the national
          two-generation approach. Corazon Hawaii will help homeless households
          focus on theirfuture, through housing navigation, housing retention,
          and housing stabilization. We connect households with housingwhile

          the skills and confidence to change their circumstances for good.{" "}
